After using 9 to 10 month I clearly say that this product is very good sound quality with good noise cancelling but but but it have one big problem . The transparency mode is very bad .When you on your transparency mode you hear something like broken speaker sound .Otherwise best headphones at this price range .Also very good battery life .From student prospective it will never disappoint you .App is also very minimal.Mic quality I say okayish type .Design wise you feel like a boss . It never disappointed .Conform wise also very comfortable but use it max 2 hour in one time . Its my personal suggestions bcz it contain sweat on ear side.

Reviewed in India on 20 July 2025Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
For the price, Quality is exceptional!All the audio modes, Multi connectivity, ear cushions and the fit is just too good!The NC can block fan sounds, traffic sounds but not if someone is speaking or snoring right next to you lol and the application won’t let you log in but atleast you can still use all the features through phone. But id say it really is exceptional at this price, a really good decision from my end.

Good headphone
Reviewed in India on 23 September 2025Colour: BlueVerified Purchase
The headphone is comfy and lightweight. The sound quality is great and a bit bass heavy which I like. Also comes with a companion app to tune it to your liking. Noice cancellation feature works alright and the design is sleek. Overall satisfied.

Reviewed in India on 10 September 2025Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
Firstly I would really appreciate this product to be at this particular price because it's worth every penny . I bought it for 3700 and at that price if you are able to grab it please do it because it has one of the best sound and is really good . The battery is also amazing , it last me 2 weeks when I use it for 2 hours a day .I was very curious at the beginning but when I bought it , I was shocked . Please if you have a budget under 4k buy this with your eyes closed highly recommend

Good anc , amazing sound quality
Reviewed in India on 27 July 2024Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
Bought it 1 week ago , charged once , i use it hardly 2hrs a day with anc on all times, so didnt need to charge it again yet !! I use it in gym so sometime it slips while doing some exercises !! Anc is amazing as it blocks all the gym background noise of people talking , weights banging and gym speakers sound . Transparency mode is v bad as it ruins the sound quality !! Normal mode provides the best sound quality but it also reduces somewhat of the background noise !! 3.5mm cable provided in box is of low quality so i bought new ptron brand 3.5mm cable from amazon as i use it wired for gaming !! Works amazingly goood for gaming in WIRED MODE !! Also audio quality is far better in wired mode but theres no noise cancellation available in wired mode  !! Worth it for 3999/- A case for protecting those headphones shoudlve been provided as wireless headphones are fragile no matter what brand you buy !! Didnt choose its competitor Jbl660nc as that headphone doesnt have app support but soundcore headphone has a smooth helpful app . Also weight is less and connectivity issues are nonexistent !! You can go for it no doubtUpdate : 08-08-2024 . On 29th July , 2 days after recieving the product , wired mode stopped working , as i had bought other 3.5mm cable for it , it didnt work w the headphones , also the original cable also didnt work with the headphones !! i used both the cables with my redmi phone and both of them cables were working , so the headphones were at fault and werent working in wired mode !! so on 29th July itself i placed a REPLACEMENT ORDER . the replacement product shouldve arrived on 2nd JULY before 10PM . At 9;40pm on 2nd july i got a call from delivery agent saying his tire is punctured and that he cant come on 2nd july so he will come on 3rd july before afternoon !! He didnt come before afternoon and then stopped recieving my calls and then later marked the replacement as rejected by the customer FYI < I HAVENT REJECTED ANYTHING !! After this i have talked to 5 amazon representatives on helpline number who PROMISED ME that i will get my replacement on 4th July !! Ofc on 4th july again at 9:30PM i got call from AMAZON DELIVERY HEAD of our area saying that my package will arrive on 5th july !! and that lady called mansi who apparently works for amazon , right after the call ended she herself marked the replacement again as rejected by the customer !! this time i got v angry , i called helpline again , and this time they said that due to rejecting parcels many times, replacement cant occur and now i have to give it return and get refund !! thankfully i gave return and got refund on time !! but my point is , i have been prime member since 2019 and i havent ever recieved or faced such liar delivery agent and area head managers before !! they all lied and blamed it on me that im rejecting the parcels !! this is so wrong from amazon !! im not blaming anker at all , i have anker charger , charging cable and i know their after sales service is good and also the headphones can be faulty i accept , but amazon has ruined the experience for me !! now before buying any tech product from amazon ill think twice !!

Too hyped product
Reviewed in India on 17 August 2025Colour: BlackVerified Purchase
I fail to understand the hype and so many positive reviews for this headphone. In this price range, there are few other good options too.1)Good: User friendly App. Helps you to navigate and connect to the headphones faster. As marketed by the company the sound options available in the app are worth trying too. But at the end of the day, you settle down to just ONE customized setting and 'thats' where the real comparison begins.2) The cushion is very hard. If you start sweating, its very uncomfortable to use. The headset is not very comfortable over the head. The sound is not overwhelming. Its ok ok.3) The noise cancellation is superb. You won't hear anything if you turn it on.4) The sound quality during meetings and calls is also not great. The volume is always low. You sre required to speak louder for the person on the other side to hear you.I am happy with what i got but would not recommend it to anyone

Value for  money product
Reviewed in India on 4 October 2025Colour: BlueVerified Purchase
The headphones are quite comfortable on the ears, even during long hours of use. The sound quality for music is impressive with clear tones and good balance. However, the call quality is just average and could be better. The design feels a bit bulky, though it’s still easy to carry around. The overall finishing is neat and premium, and the battery life is definitely a plus point, lasting well on a single charge.
