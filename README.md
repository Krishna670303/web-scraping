This project demonstrates how to scrape data from websites using Python. It utilizes the requests library to fetch webpage content and BeautifulSoup (bs4) for parsing HTML data. The extracted information is processed and saved into a structured format (such as CSV). The project is ideal for learning or automating data collection from web pages.
